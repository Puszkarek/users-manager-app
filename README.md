# Users Manager App

This is a 'little' example of how an app constructed using Functional-reactive patterns (FRP)

## Development server

Run `npm run serve:www` and `npm run serve:api` to be able to run locally. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change one of the source files.

P.S: You can go to `http://localhost:3333/api/ping` to check if the api is working properly, it's should return a `pong` message with 200 status

### Partners

We have to follow some principles to achieve a clean and very well structured project, in resume the patterns are:

- Immutable Data - All the data should be unique, what means in the practice that we don't to things like:
  - `let someValue = 'mutable'`
  - `object.someValue = 'new-value`

### Project Structure

We are using an file structure inspired in the [Josh Article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/), he structure use a more readable way to organize big projects.
Looks at the following structure:

```
app/
  â””â”€ pages/
           â”œâ”€ auth-page/
                    â””â”€ auth-form/
                               â””â”€ auth-header/
```

Follow this pattern can be confuse to search by a specific component that we not know, besides also will fill the imports with sub-folders very very faster. Instead, we can always group the files by functionality:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ auth-form/
â”‚           â””â”€ auth-header/
â””â”€â”€ pages/
			â””â”€â”€ auth-page/
```

You will always know which place search by something

The final structure will look like:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ directives/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ guards/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ guards/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interfaces/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pipes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stores/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â””â”€â”€ styles/
```
